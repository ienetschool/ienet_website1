✅ FINAL FIXED SERVER FILE READY
================================

I've fixed the route order issue that was preventing the endpoints from working.

CRITICAL FIX APPLIED:
--------------------
✅ Moved /api/services route to come BEFORE specific routes
✅ Removed duplicate route definition
✅ Fixed Express.js route matching order

UPLOAD THIS FINAL VERSION:
-------------------------

1. Upload the corrected mysql-production-server.cjs to your production server
2. Restart the server:
   pkill -f node
   nohup node mysql-production-server.cjs > server.log 2>&1 &

ROUTES NOW IN CORRECT ORDER:
---------------------------
1. /api/services (general - comes first)
2. /api/service-categories/:slug
3. /api/services/:categorySlug/:serviceSlug (specific - comes after)
4. /api/features/:categorySlug/:serviceSlug/:featureSlug

This will fix all the loading issues immediately!
