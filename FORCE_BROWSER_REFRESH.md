# BROWSER CACHE ISSUE - FORCE REFRESH REQUIRED

## Current Status:
✅ Production server has correct files deployed
✅ index.html references the corrected JavaScript bundle (index-Dd5d5Jg_.js)  
✅ Static HTML backup pages work correctly (contact.html shows "Contact IeNet")

## The Issue:
Your browser is still loading the old cached JavaScript file. This is a common issue when updating React applications.

## SOLUTION: Force Browser Cache Clear

Please try these steps **in order**:

### Step 1: Hard Refresh
- **Windows/Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Shift + R`

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache
- Open Developer Tools (F12)
- Right-click the refresh button
- Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Step 3: Incognito/Private Mode
- Open a new incognito/private browser window
- Visit https://www.ienet.online/contact
- This should show the corrected content

### Step 4: Static Page Test
- Visit https://www.ienet.online/contact.html (note the .html extension)
- This should definitely show "Contact IeNet" as it bypasses React entirely

## Technical Details:
- The React app has been updated with correct content
- Production server has the new JavaScript files
- Browser cache is preventing loading of updated files
- This is a client-side caching issue, not a server issue

## Expected Result:
After clearing browser cache, you should see "Contact IeNet" instead of "Contact India Espectacular" on the contact page.
