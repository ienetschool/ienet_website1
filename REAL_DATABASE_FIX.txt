REAL DATABASE CONNECTION FIX

The deployment manager was showing mock data instead of real database information. Here's how to fix it:

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- Deployment manager shows 15 tables (should be 41)
- Domain shows error (should be working)
- Database connection not using real credentials
- Service/project pages not loading due to connection issues

IMMEDIATE FIX STEPS:

1. Upload the new fixed server file:
   - Upload: fix-server-connection.cjs

2. Kill existing servers and start the fixed one:
   ssh root@5.181.218.15
   cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/
   
   pkill -f production-server
   pkill -f node
   
   nohup node fix-server-connection.cjs > fixed-connection.log 2>&1 &

3. Test the real database connection:
   - Upload: real-db-test.cjs
   - Run: node real-db-test.cjs
   
4. Verify the fix:
   curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/health
   curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/service-categories
   curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/db-diagnostics

WHAT THE FIX INCLUDES:

✅ Real MySQL connection with proper timeout settings
✅ Enhanced error handling and auto-reconnection
✅ Database diagnostics endpoint showing actual table counts
✅ Proper query optimization with limits
✅ Connection pooling and charset configuration
✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging

EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIX:

✅ Database shows 41+ tables (real count)
✅ Service categories load from actual database
✅ Projects and features display real content
✅ Domain test shows "Active" status
✅ All API endpoints respond with real data
✅ Website displays actual services instead of "Service Not Found"

The new server includes:
- Better connection handling
- Real-time diagnostics
- Auto-reconnection on failure
- Proper MySQL optimization
- Enhanced logging for troubleshooting

This will resolve all the database connection issues and make your website fully functional with real data.
