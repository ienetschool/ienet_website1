EMERGENCY FIX - NO DEPENDENCIES REQUIRED

The previous server failed due to missing npm packages. 
Use this simple server that only requires built-in Node.js modules:

1. Kill any existing server:
   ssh root@5.181.218.15
   cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/
   pkill -f production-server
   pkill -f node

2. Upload simple-production-server.cjs to your server

3. Start the emergency server:
   nohup node simple-production-server.cjs > emergency-server.log 2>&1 &

4. Verify it's working:
   netstat -tulpn | grep 3001
   curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/health
   curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/service-categories

ADVANTAGES:
- No npm packages required (uses built-in Node.js modules)
- Includes sample service categories data
- Proper CORS headers
- Comprehensive logging
- Should start immediately

This will fix the "Service Not Found" errors and get your website working while we can later upgrade to the MySQL version.

EXPECTED RESULT:
✅ Port 3001 listening
✅ API endpoints responding
✅ Website shows service categories instead of "Service Not Found"
