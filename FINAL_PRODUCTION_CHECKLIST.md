# FINAL SOLUTION FOR IENET.ONLINE

## Current Problem
Your website shows a static production status page instead of the React application.

## Root Cause
A static HTML file was uploaded instead of the React server application.

## Solution Ready
I've created `clean-react-deploy/` with your exact React application:

### Files to Upload to Plesk /ienet.online/:
1. **index.js** - Simple Express server for React app
2. **package.json** - Production dependencies
3. **public/** - Your built React application with all components

### React Application Includes:
- HeroSlider with website development theme
- ModernHeader with navigation
- About section with company stats
- Services section with 6 service cards
- Testimonials with gradient background
- FloatingCTA buttons (WhatsApp, Get in Touch, Live Chat)
- Responsive design and professional styling

### Plesk Configuration:
- Application Startup File: **index.js**
- Application Mode: production
- Node.js Version: 18.x

### Commands:
1. Upload clean-react-deploy/ contents
2. Click "NPM install"
3. Click "Restart App"

### Expected Result:
ienet.online will show your React application with all components, NOT the static production status page.

The React application is tested and ready for deployment.
