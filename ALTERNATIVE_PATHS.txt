ALTERNATIVE FILE LOCATIONS TO TRY

If the current setup isn't working, try these different paths in Plesk File Manager:

=== OPTION 1: httpdocs folder ===
Create: /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/httpdocs/index.html
Apache directive: DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/httpdocs

=== OPTION 2: public_html folder ===
Create: /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/public_html/index.html
Apache directive: DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/public_html

=== OPTION 3: www folder ===
Create: /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/www/index.html
Apache directive: DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/www

=== OPTION 4: Default Plesk path ===
Check what's the default document root in Plesk domain settings and put index.html there.

=== QUICK TEST ===
For each option:
1. Create the folder if it doesn't exist
2. Copy index.html content there
3. Update Apache directive to point to that folder
4. Click Apply
5. Test https://www.ienet.online

The correct path will show your professional India Espectacular website immediately.
