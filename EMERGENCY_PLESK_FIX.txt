QUICK SOLUTIONS:

1. CHECK PLESK HOSTING PANEL:
   - Log into Plesk control panel
   - Go to ienet.online domain settings
   - Check if Node.js is enabled
   - Enable Node.js application support

2. PLESK NODE.JS SETUP:
   - In Plesk: Hosting & DNS > Node.js
   - Set Node.js version (18.x or 20.x)
   - Set Application Root: /
   - Set Application Startup File: dist/index.js
   - Set Environment: production

3. PLESK FILE MANAGER UPLOAD:
   - Use Plesk File Manager
   - Upload production-deploy files to httpdocs/
   - Set correct permissions (755 for folders, 644 for files)

4. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES IN PLESK:
   - Go to Node.js settings in Plesk
   - Click "Install Dependencies" or run: npm install --production

5. START APPLICATION:

- This gives immediate working website while fixing Node.js

RESULT: Website should show React application or working static version
