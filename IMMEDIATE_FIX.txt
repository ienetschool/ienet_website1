IMMEDIATE 502 FIX - NO DATABASE REQUIRED

The problem: API server keeps crashing due to MySQL connection issues.
SOLUTION: Use simple server with hardcoded data (same as development server).

UPLOAD THIS FILE TO SERVER:
- simple-production-server.cjs

RUN THESE COMMANDS:

ssh root@5.181.218.15
cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/

# Stop all Node.js processes
pkill -f "node" || true

# Start simple server (no database needed)
nohup node simple-production-server.cjs > api.log 2>&1 &

# Test immediately
curl localhost:3001/api/health
curl https://www.ienet.online/api/health

EXPECTED RESULT:
- API returns JSON (not HTML)
- Service categories load on homepage
- Projects section shows data
- No more 502 errors

This bypasses all database issues and gets your website working immediately.
You can add MySQL database later once the basic API is working.
