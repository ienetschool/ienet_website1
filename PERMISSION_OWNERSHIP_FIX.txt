EXACT PERMISSION FIX

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Files have wrong ownership
- Current: nginx:nginx (wrong)  
- Should be: vivassh:psaserv (correct for Plesk)

RUN THESE COMMANDS IN SSH:

ssh root@5.181.218.15
cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/

# Fix ALL file/folder ownership to correct Plesk user/group
chown -R vivassh:psaserv *
chown -R vivassh:psaserv .*

# Set correct permissions  
chmod 755 .
chmod 644 index.html
chmod 755 assets/
chmod 644 assets/*
chmod 644 production-server.cjs

# Verify the fix
ls -la

# Test the website
curl -I https://www.ienet.online

EXPECTED RESULT:
All files should show "vivassh psaserv" ownership
Website should load with 200 OK status instead of 403 Forbidden
