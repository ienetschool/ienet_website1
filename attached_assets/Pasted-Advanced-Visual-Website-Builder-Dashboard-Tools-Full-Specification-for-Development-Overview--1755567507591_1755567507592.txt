Advanced Visual Website Builder & Dashboard Tools ‚Äî Full Specification for Development
üöÄ Overview

We currently have a basic website dashboard with a simple code/text editor. We want to evolve it into a fully integrated visual website builder, similar to Webflow, Elementor Pro, or Builder.io. This system should provide a professional, scalable experience for content creators, marketers, and developers to:

Visually build and manage live pages

Perform inline editing and drag-and-drop layout

Manage SEO, metadata, and structured schema

Optimize for performance and accessibility

Use advanced tables with pagination, sorting, filtering, exporting, and row actions

üìÅ BONUS MODULE: Advanced Data Table with Pagination & Tools

You will also implement a data management grid/table for admin sections (e.g., users, leads, products), supporting:

Features:

Server-side pagination, filtering, and sorting (via SQL or ORM)

Column filters for text, dropdown, or date ranges

Global search across all columns

Sorting with visual indicators (asc/desc)

Export options: CSV, Excel, JSON

Action buttons: Edit, Delete, View, Custom (modal or link)

Batch actions (e.g., bulk delete)

API Considerations:

Should return: data rows, total count, page count, metadata

Export API should reflect current filters/sorts
