FINAL ASSETS FIX

Website is loading (200 OK) but CSS/JS files are 404.

RUN THESE COMMANDS:

ssh root@5.181.218.15
cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/

# Check if assets folder exists
ls -la assets/

# If assets missing, recreate it and upload the files:
mkdir -p assets
chown vivassh:psaserv assets
chmod 755 assets

# You need to re-upload these 2 files to assets/ folder:
# - index-4CY-Uz3T.css (195KB)  
# - index-6-PKYvps.js (1.8MB)

# After uploading, set permissions:
chown vivassh:psaserv assets/*
chmod 644 assets/*

# Test
curl -I https://www.ienet.online/assets/index-4CY-Uz3T.css

RESULT: Your React app will be fully functional once the CSS/JS assets are uploaded.
