NGINX CONFIGURATION FIX

Problem: Duplicate location "/" block error in Plesk Nginx configuration.

SOLUTION - Use this configuration instead:

In Plesk > Domains > ienet.online > Apache & nginx Settings > Additional nginx directives:

REMOVE the current configuration and use this instead:

location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg)$ {
    expires 1y;
    add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
}

location ~ ^/(?!api/) {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}

This configuration:
1. Won't conflict with existing location / block
2. Handles static assets (JS, CSS, images)
3. Routes all non-API requests to index.html for React Router
4. Leaves API requests (/api/*) to be handled by your Node.js server

ALTERNATIVE - Simple fix:
Just remove ALL nginx directives from the Additional nginx directives box and click OK.
Your React app might work with just the correct file permissions.
