SIMPLE ROOT DOMAIN FIX

You're right - we don't need httpdocs. Your files should work from the domain root.

The 500 error on /index.html suggests the file exists but something is wrong with it.

RUN THESE COMMANDS:

ssh root@5.181.218.15
cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/

# Check if index.html actually has content
cat index.html

# Check file sizes - they should match what we uploaded
ls -lh index.html assets/

# If index.html is empty or corrupted, recreate it with simple test
echo "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Test</title></head><body><h1>Working!</h1></body></html>" > test.html
chown vivassh:psaserv test.html
curl https://www.ienet.online/test.html

# Check what's in the assets folder
ls -la assets/

If the test.html works but index.html doesn't, then the React index.html file was corrupted during upload and needs to be re-uploaded.
