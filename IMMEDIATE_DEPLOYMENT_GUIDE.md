## EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Copy Files to Production Server
Upload the following file to your production server:
- Copy `public/index.html` to `/var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/public/index.html`

### Step 2: SSH Commands for Production Server (IP: 5.181.218.15)

```bash
# Connect to server
ssh root@5.181.218.15

# Navigate to website directory
cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online

# Create public directory
mkdir -p public

# Create the static website file
cat > public/index.html << 'EOF'
[Paste the contents of public/index.html from this project]
EOF

# Set proper permissions
chown -R ienet:ienet public/
chmod -R 755 public/

# Create .htaccess for proper routing
cat > public/.htaccess << 'EOF'
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /

# Serve static files first
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f
RewriteRule ^.*$ - [L]

# Fallback to index.html for SPA routing
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^.*$ /index.html [L]

# Security headers
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
