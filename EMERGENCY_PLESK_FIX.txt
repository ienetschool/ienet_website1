EMERGENCY PLESK SERVER FIX
=========================

PROBLEM: Server not responding after file replacement
SOLUTION: Use Plesk File Manager to fix directly

PLESK FILE MANAGER STEPS:
========================

1. Login to your Plesk Control Panel
2. Go to "File Manager" 
3. Navigate to your domain folder (ienet.online)
4. Find mysql-production-server.cjs

5. IF FILE IS CORRUPTED:
   - Delete mysql-production-server.cjs
   - Upload a fresh copy of EXACT_SAME_PRODUCTION_SERVER.cjs
   - Rename it to mysql-production-server.cjs

6. RESTART NODE.JS IN PLESK:
   - Go to "Node.js" section in Plesk
   - Find your application
   - Click "Restart"
   - OR use "npm start" or your startup command

ALTERNATIVE - QUICK RECOVERY:
============================
If you have backup file:
1. Delete current mysql-production-server.cjs
2. Rename mysql-production-server.cjs.backup to mysql-production-server.cjs
3. Restart Node.js application in Plesk

This will restore the working server while we debug the new file.
