# AUTOMATED DEPLOYMENT - Server Access Required

## If You Want Automated Deployment:

I can deploy directly to your production server if you provide access credentials. This would automatically:
- Upload all updated files
- Restart your server
- Verify deployment success
- Test all updated pages

## Required Information:

### FTP/SFTP Access:
- **Host**: your-server.com or IP address
- **Port**: (usually 21 for FTP, 22 for SFTP)
- **Username**: your FTP username
- **Password**: your FTP password
- **Web Directory Path**: /public_html/ or /httpdocs/ or similar

### Server Control:
- **Hosting Panel**: Plesk, cPanel, etc.
- **Panel Username/Password**: (if different from FTP)
- **Node.js Restart Method**: How you currently restart your app

### Alternative - SSH Access:
- **SSH Host**: your server IP or domain
- **SSH Port**: (usually 22)
- **SSH Username**: 
- **SSH Password** or **SSH Key**

## Current Deployment Package Size:
- Website files (dist/): ~2MB
- Server file: ~45KB
- Total upload: ~2.1MB

## Security Note:
I'll use the credentials only for this deployment and won't store them. All access details will be used temporarily to upload files and restart your server.

## Manual Alternative:
If you prefer to upload manually, you need to:
1. Upload contents of `dist/public/` folder to your web directory
2. Upload `updated-production-server-with-fixes.cjs` to your server location
3. Restart your Node.js application

**Which option do you prefer - automated deployment or manual upload instructions?**
