Breakdown of Reported Issues
❌ /pages showing "0" pages

Issue:

Despite having many records, the total pages count is 0 — this suggests the pagination metadata is not being calculated or returned correctly from the backend or displayed incorrectly on the frontend.

Likely Causes:

Backend not returning correct total or last_page values

Frontend is not interpreting the pagination metadata properly

Fix Suggestions:

Check API response: Ensure it returns { total, per_page, current_page, last_page }

Validate how the pagination component uses these values

❌ /dashboard/Services and /dashboard/sub-services showing the same data

Issue:

Both routes are pulling and showing the same values. Likely a filtering bug or shared component using the same API.

Likely Causes:

API call for both components is hitting the same endpoint

No filtering by parent_id, type, or similar

Possibly reusing the same state/data incorrectly

Fix Suggestions:

Verify the API endpoint for both routes is different

Check if sub-services are properly filtered by a parent service or type

Ensure no shared global state is overriding each other

❌ /dashboard/features → Edit and Eye button not working

Issue:

Both buttons are non-functional.

Likely Causes:

No onClick handlers bound

Wrong route or missing route parameter (e.g., feature ID)

Component missing import of navigate() or router.push() method

Fix Suggestions:

Confirm that buttons are connected:

<button onClick={() => handleEdit(feature.id)}>Edit</button>


Ensure routes like /dashboard/features/edit/:id are defined and working

"Eye" button (typically for "view") should route to a detail view or open a modal. If unused, remove it or clarify its purpose

❌ Eye button still not working (Unknown purpose)

Issue:

Still unclear what the "eye" icon is supposed to do

Recommendation:

Decide whether it's for:

Viewing details in a modal?

Navigating to a detail page?

If unused, remove it to avoid user confusion

❌ /dashboard/projects → Edit button not working

Issue:

No functionality on the edit button

Fix Suggestions:

Check button binding:

<button onClick={() => navigate(`/dashboard/projects/edit/${project.id}`)}>Edit</button>


Verify route is defined in router

Confirm project ID is passed properly
