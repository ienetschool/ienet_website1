COMPLETE MYSQL PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

I've created a comprehensive installation script just like the PostgreSQL install files we used before.

UPLOAD AND RUN:

1. UPLOAD install-mysql-production.js to your server

2. RUN the complete installation:
   ssh root@5.181.218.15
   cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/
   node install-mysql-production.js

This complete script will:
✅ Test database connection with full error handling
✅ Create all tables with proper indexes and foreign keys  
✅ Insert comprehensive sample data (categories, services, features, projects)
✅ Validate all relationships and data integrity
✅ Generate production configuration file
✅ Provide detailed success/error reporting

3. RESTART Node.js application in Plesk

4. TEST the complete setup:
   curl https://www.ienet.online/api/health
   curl https://www.ienet.online/api/service-categories

This is a complete, production-ready installation that mirrors the comprehensive setup we used for PostgreSQL development.
