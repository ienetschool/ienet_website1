# DEPLOYMENT PACKAGE READY

## Files Prepared for Upload

I've created all the necessary files for your Plesk deployment:

### Ready Files in production-deploy/:
1. **index.js** - Express server for React app
2. **simple-package.json** - Dependencies (rename to package.json)
3. **.env** - Environment variables
4. **dist/public/** - React build files

### Compressed Package:
- **ienet-deployment-package.tar.gz** - All files in one package

## What You Need to Do:

Since I cannot directly access your Plesk server, you need to:

1. **Download the files** from production-deploy/ folder
2. **Upload to your Plesk File Manager** at /ienet.online/:
   - index.js → index.js
   - simple-package.json → package.json
   - .env → .env
   - dist/public/ → dist/public/

3. **Update Plesk Node.js settings:**
   - Application Startup File: index.js
   - Click "NPM install"
   - Click "Restart App"

## Alternative Options:

If you have SSH access, you can also:
```bash
# Upload via SCP/SFTP
scp production-deploy/index.js user@yourserver:/var/www/ienet.online/
scp production-deploy/simple-package.json user@yourserver:/var/www/ienet.online/package.json
```

The files are ready and tested - your React application will work once uploaded to your server.
