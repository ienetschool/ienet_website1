403 FORBIDDEN ERROR FIX

The files are uploaded and Node.js is disabled, but you're getting 403 Forbidden.
This means Apache doesn't have permission to read your files.

RUN THESE COMMANDS ON YOUR SERVER:

ssh root@5.181.218.15
cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/

# Fix file permissions
chown -R vivaiind:psacln ./*
chmod -R 644 ./*
chmod 755 .
chmod 755 assets/

# Verify files are there
ls -la

# Check if .htaccess is uploaded (upload it if not)
ls -la .htaccess

# Restart Apache (if needed)
systemctl reload apache2

# Check the website
curl -I https://www.ienet.online

The 403 error should be fixed after setting the correct file permissions.
Your files are there, they just need the right ownership and permissions.
