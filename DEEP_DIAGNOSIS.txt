DEEP 403 DIAGNOSIS

The permissions are fixed but still 403. Let's check the actual file location and structure.

RUN THESE DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS:

ssh root@5.181.218.15

# Check the domain document root setting in Plesk
grep -r "ienet.online" /var/www/vhosts/system/ienet.online/conf/ 2>/dev/null

# Check what's actually in the domain folder
cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/
pwd
ls -la

# Check if files are in httpdocs subfolder (common Plesk setup)
ls -la httpdocs/ 2>/dev/null

# Check if index.html has content
file index.html
head -5 index.html 2>/dev/null

# Check what Nginx is actually serving as document root
nginx -T 2>/dev/null | grep -A 5 -B 5 ienet.online

# Alternative: Check Plesk's actual document root
plesk bin domain --info ienet.online 2>/dev/null

POSSIBLE ISSUES:
1. Files uploaded to wrong directory (should be in httpdocs/)
2. Nginx document root pointing to different location  
3. Files corrupted during upload
4. SELinux or other security preventing access

QUICK FIX TO TEST:
# Try copying files to httpdocs if it exists
cp index.html httpdocs/ 2>/dev/null
cp -r assets httpdocs/ 2>/dev/null
