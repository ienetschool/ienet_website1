Deployment Plan for Production Server
1. Move Website from Port 5000 to Root Domain

Current: https://www.ienet.online:5000

Target: https://www.ienet.online (default HTTPS port 443)

Steps:

Update web server configuration (likely Nginx or Apache) to:

Proxy or serve your app at root /

Remove port 5000 from public access

Update any hardcoded URLs in:

Frontend templates

Backend redirects

Restart web server and test deployment

ðŸ“Œ Check if Gunicorn/Uvicorn is used, and if so, reverse-proxy it correctly behind Nginx.

2. Fix Broken Pages

Especially pages like:

/services/cybersecurity-solutions/cybersecurity-solutions-custom-development

Sub-services, project pages, features, etc.

Steps:

Audit the routing and URL generation logic (Flask/Django/Express/etc.)

Check database content for those pages

Confirm slugs/URLs are correct

Check for:

404s

Template rendering errors

Broken links or missing data

3. Ensure Full Site Works with MySQL

Confirm the app is connected to MySQL in production (not SQLite or memory DB)

Test:

Data fetching (pages load data correctly)

Data submission (forms, contact, etc.)

Admin/backend panels if any

Check database logs for any SQL errors

4. Manual Testing Checklist

 Homepage and all navigation links

 Services main page + each service subpage

 Projects page and individual projects

 Contact form and any user input

 Login/Signup (if applicable)

 Admin panel (if exists)

 Mobile responsiveness

 SEO tags & sitemaps

 Load time/performance

 HTTPS and SSL certificates (no mixed content)

âœ… Deliverables

Once completed, you will receive:

Live site on root domain (https://www.ienet.online)

All broken links and pages fixed

Functionality verified end-to-end with MySQL

Final deployment + testing report

ðŸ”§ Before I proceed

Please confirm the following:

Web server used: Nginx, Apache, or something else?

App stack: Flask, Django, Node.js, PHP, etc.?

Access info: Do you have SSH or cPanel access to the production server?

Current DB setup: Is MySQL already populated and in use, or does it need to be migrated from another DB?

Once I have this info, I can give you either:

The exact commands/configuration needed, or

Help you execute it step-by-step.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.
