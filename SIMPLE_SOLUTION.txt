SIMPLEST SOLUTION - Try This First:

Since mkdir is failing, let's put the file directly in the main directory:

=== OPTION 1: Direct File Placement ===

1. Go to Plesk File Manager
2. Navigate to: /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/
3. Create file: index.html (directly in this folder, not in public)
4. Paste the HTML content

Then update nginx to:
location / {
    root /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online;
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    index index.html;
}

=== OPTION 2: Check Current Directory ===

Maybe the path is different. Try these SSH commands:

ls -la /var/www/vhosts/
ls -la /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/
pwd

This will show you the exact directory structure.

=== OPTION 3: Use httpdocs folder ===

Many Plesk setups use httpdocs:

1. Navigate to: /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/httpdocs/
2. Create index.html there
3. Update nginx to:
   root /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/httpdocs;

=== TEST AFTER EACH OPTION ===

After creating the file and updating nginx:
1. Click OK in Plesk
2. Click Apply
3. Visit https://www.ienet.online

The website should show immediately with:
