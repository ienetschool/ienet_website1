# IMMEDIATE CONTACT PAGE FIX

I understand your frustration. The issue is persistent browser/CDN caching. Here's the immediate solution:

## Problem:
- React source code shows "Contact IeNet" (correct)
- But production still serves "Contact India Espectacular" 
- This is a caching issue despite deploying correct files

## IMMEDIATE FIX: Use Static HTML

Since the React app has persistent caching issues, let's use the working static HTML version:

1. **Visit: https://www.ienet.online/contact.html** (note the .html)
   - This static page shows "Contact IeNet" correctly
   - No React, no caching issues

2. **Make this the main contact page** by configuring the server to serve contact.html when users visit /contact

3. **Browser cache clearing** (for the React version):
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R 
   - Open Developer Tools → Network tab → check "Disable cache"
   - Try incognito/private browsing mode

## Technical Status:
✅ Source code fixed (shows "Contact IeNet")
✅ Static HTML backup working (contact.html shows "Contact IeNet")  
❌ React app still cached (showing old content)

The static HTML solution guarantees it works immediately while we resolve the React caching.
