RESTART PRODUCTION SERVER NOW
============================

You uploaded the file correctly, but the server needs to be restarted.

IN YOUR SSH TERMINAL, RUN:
-------------------------

1. Stop the old server:
   pkill -f node

2. Start the new server:
   nohup node mysql-production-server.cjs > server.log 2>&1 &

3. Check if it's running:
   ps aux | grep node

VERIFICATION:
------------
After restart, test this URL:
curl "https://www.ienet.online/api/services/digital-marketing-seo/search-engine-optimization"

It should return service data instead of "Endpoint not found".
