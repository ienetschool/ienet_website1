FINAL DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS - Copy and paste these exactly:

Since you have SSH access, run these commands in your terminal:

# 1. Kill any existing processes
pkill -f "node" 2>/dev/null || true

# 2. Download the working deployment (run this from your local machine)
scp final-working-deployment.tar.gz root@5.181.218.15:~/

# 3. SSH to server and run these commands:
ssh root@5.181.218.15

# 4. Once connected to server, run:
cd ~/
tar -xzf final-working-deployment.tar.gz
ls -la dist/public/

# 5. Start the server:
node simple-working-server.cjs

Expected output:
- Server running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
- External URL: http://ienet.online:5000
- Database connected: 25 service categories found
- Server startup complete!

# 6. Test in another terminal:
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# 7. If everything works, run it in background:
nohup node simple-working-server.cjs > server.log 2>&1 &

The website at http://ienet.online:5000 should now show the exact same content as your development server.
