# Production Deployment Status

## Current Issue
The Node.js application in Plesk shows "Application will be restarted after the first request" but the API is returning 502 errors. This means the MySQL production server isn't starting properly.

## Immediate Actions Needed

### 1. Force Restart the Node.js Application
In Plesk Node.js panel:
- Click "Restart App" button
- Wait for status to change to "Running"
- If it shows errors, check the application logs

### 2. Manual Server Start (if needed)
If Plesk restart fails:
```bash
ssh root@5.181.218.15
cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/
pkill -f node
nohup node mysql-production-server.cjs > app.log 2>&1 &
```

### 3. Test the API After Restart
```bash
curl https://www.ienet.online/api/health
curl https://www.ienet.online/api/service-categories
```

## Expected Results After Fix
- API health check returns MySQL connection status
- Service categories load from database instead of "Service Not Found"
- All pages (services, projects, etc.) display real content
- Website fully functional with MySQL backend

## Database Status
✅ MySQL database configured with full schema
✅ Sample data inserted (categories, services, features, projects)  
✅ Production server file (mysql-production-server.cjs) ready
❌ Node.js application needs manual restart

The database and files are ready - just need to get the Node.js application running.
