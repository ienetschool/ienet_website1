PLESK CONFIGURATION ISSUE

Problem: Plesk is trying to run your React files as a Node.js application instead of serving them as static files.

Error: "Web application could not be started by the Phusion Passenger application server"

SOLUTION - Configure Plesk for Static Files:

1. In Plesk Control Panel:
   - Go to Domains > ienet.online
   - Click "Hosting Settings" or "Apache & nginx Settings"
   - Set Document Root to: /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online
   - Disable "Node.js" if enabled
   - Enable "Static files" serving

2. Alternative - Create .htaccess file:
   Upload this .htaccess file to /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/:

   ```
   RewriteEngine On
   RewriteBase /
   
   # Handle Angular and React Router
   RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
   RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
   
   # Serve static assets
   RewriteRule ^assets/(.*)$ assets/$1 [L]
   ```

3. API Server Configuration:
   The API server (production-server.cjs) should run separately:
   
   ssh root@5.181.218.15
   cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/
   npm install mysql2 express
   nohup node production-server.cjs > api.log 2>&1 &

The React files are uploaded correctly, but Plesk needs to serve them as static files, not try to run them as a Node.js app.
