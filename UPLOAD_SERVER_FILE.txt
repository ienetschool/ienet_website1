SERVER FILE UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS
================================

If the mysql-production-server.cjs file is missing from your production server, 
you need to upload it from this development environment.

The file exists here and is working properly. You can:

1. OPTION 1 - Copy via SCP:
   scp mysql-production-server.cjs username@your-server:/var/www/vhosts/ienet.online/httpdocs/

2. OPTION 2 - Copy/Paste Content:
   - View the file content in this development environment
   - Create the file manually on production server using nano or vi
   - Copy the entire content

3. OPTION 3 - Use Plesk File Manager:
   - Go to Plesk Panel > File Manager
   - Navigate to httpdocs directory
   - Upload the mysql-production-server.cjs file

The file contains all the MySQL database connections and API endpoints needed for the production server to work.

Once uploaded, run:
nohup node mysql-production-server.cjs > server.log 2>&1 &
