FINAL STEP - RESTART NODE.JS APPLICATION

✅ Database schema created successfully (I can see from your screenshot)
✅ mysql-production-server.cjs uploaded and configured as startup file
❌ Node.js app still needs restart to use new configuration

IMMEDIATE ACTION:

1. In the Plesk Node.js panel, click "Restart App" button
2. Wait for status to show "Running"
3. Check logs for any errors

After restart, test:
curl https://www.ienet.online/api/health

This should return:
{
  "status": "healthy", 
  "message": "MySQL Production server running",
  "database": "connected"
}

And your website will load service categories from the MySQL database instead of showing "Service Not Found".
