IMMEDIATE PRODUCTION FIX NEEDED
===============================

PROBLEM: Production server is still running old code with missing API endpoints
EVIDENCE: curl shows "Endpoint not found" for working development routes

SIMPLE 3-STEP SOLUTION:
=======================

STEP 1: SSH to your production server
STEP 2: Replace mysql-production-server.cjs with EXACT_SAME_PRODUCTION_SERVER.cjs
STEP 3: Restart: pkill -f node && nohup node mysql-production-server.cjs &

WHAT WILL BE FIXED:
==================
✅ Missing page titles 
✅ "Features being loaded..." errors
✅ "Loading related services..." errors  
✅ All API endpoints will work like development

VERIFICATION:
============
After restart, this should work:
https://www.ienet.online/services/digital-marketing-seo/search-engine-optimization

The page will show proper title and load all content correctly.

WHY THIS WORKS:
==============
The new file contains exact copy of working development server routes,
just adapted for MySQL database. Same logic, same endpoints, same results.
