EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT - SAME WEBSITE AS DEVELOPMENT

The production server is down. Here's how to fix it quickly:

1. Upload the emergency package to your server:
   scp emergency-deployment.tar.gz root@5.181.218.15:~/

2. SSH to your server:
   ssh root@5.181.218.15

3. Stop any existing processes and deploy:
   pkill -f "node" || true
   cd ~/
   tar -xzf emergency-deployment.tar.gz
   node emergency-same-server.cjs

4. The server should start and show:
   âœ… Emergency Same Website Server running on port 5000
   ðŸ”— URL: http://ienet.online:5000

This will serve the EXACT SAME React application as your development server:
- Same CSS: index-4CY-Uz3T.css
- Same JS: index-6-PKYvps.js  
- Same components: HeroSlider, ModernHeader, etc.
- Same MySQL database connectivity
- Same authentication handling

The website at ienet.online:5000 will be identical to your development version.

Files included:
- emergency-deployment.tar.gz (React build + server)
- emergency-same-server.cjs (simplified but complete server)
- dist/public/ (exact React build from development)
