✅ PRODUCTION SERVER FILE FIXED
===============================

I've fixed the duplicate route issue in the mysql-production-server.cjs file.

UPLOAD AND RESTART:
------------------

1. Upload the corrected mysql-production-server.cjs file to your production server
2. Restart the server:
   pkill -f node
   nohup node mysql-production-server.cjs > server.log 2>&1 &

3. Test the endpoints:
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/services/digital-marketing-seo/search-engine-optimization

WHAT WAS FIXED:
--------------
✅ Removed duplicate /api/services route
✅ Added proper individual service endpoints
✅ Added individual feature endpoints
✅ Added service category endpoints

After this restart, all the loading issues should be resolved!
