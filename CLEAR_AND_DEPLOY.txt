CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS FOR PRODUCTION FIX
====================================

PROBLEM: Production server is using old file with missing endpoints
SOLUTION: Replace with exact copy of working development server

WHAT TO DO:
-----------

1. Download "EXACT_SAME_PRODUCTION_SERVER.cjs" from this Replit
2. Upload it to your production server 
3. Rename it to: mysql-production-server.cjs
4. Restart server with: pkill -f node && nohup node mysql-production-server.cjs &

EXPECTED RESULT:
---------------
✅ Title will show: "Search Engine Optimization"  
✅ Features will load properly
✅ Related services will load
✅ All API endpoints will work exactly like development

The file contains the exact same working code from development server,
just connected to your MySQL database instead of PostgreSQL.
