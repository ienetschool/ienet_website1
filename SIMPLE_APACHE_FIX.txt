SIMPLE APACHE FIX FOR INTERNAL SERVER ERROR

The 500 error suggests Apache configuration issues. Let's use the simplest possible setup:

=== STEP 1: Clear All Directives ===
In Plesk:
- Clear "Additional Apache directives for HTTP" (delete everything)
- Clear "Additional Apache directives for HTTPS" (delete everything)  
- Clear "Additional nginx directives" (delete everything)

=== STEP 2: Simple Apache Directives ===
Add ONLY this to "Additional Apache directives for HTTP":

DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online

Add ONLY this to "Additional Apache directives for HTTPS":

DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online

=== STEP 3: Move index.html to Root ===
In Plesk File Manager:
1. Make sure index.html is in: /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/index.html
2. NOT in a subfolder

=== STEP 4: Alternative Location ===
If the above doesn't work, try putting index.html in:
/var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/httpdocs/index.html

And use these directives:
HTTP: DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/httpdocs
HTTPS: DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/httpdocs

=== STEP 5: Test ===
1. Click OK
2. Click Apply  
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Visit https://www.ienet.online
