FINAL STEP - UPLOAD ASSET FILES

✅ Website is working (HTTP 200 OK)
✅ index.html serving correctly
❌ Need to upload CSS/JS files to assets folder

STEP 1 - Create assets folder:
ssh root@5.181.218.15
cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/
mkdir -p assets
chown vivassh:psaserv assets
chmod 755 assets

STEP 2 - Upload these 2 files to assets/ folder:
From your Repl download and upload to server:

1. dist/public/assets/index-4CY-Uz3T.css (195KB)
2. dist/public/assets/index-6-PKYvps.js (1.8MB)

STEP 3 - Set permissions after upload:
chown vivassh:psaserv assets/*
chmod 644 assets/*

STEP 4 - Test complete website:
curl -I https://www.ienet.online/assets/index-4CY-Uz3T.css
curl -I https://www.ienet.online/assets/index-6-PKYvps.js

Once these files are uploaded, your React application will be fully functional at:
https://www.ienet.online

The same exact website as your development server!
