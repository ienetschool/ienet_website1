You're absolutely right — the **Page Builder** and content editing flow should be **simple, intuitive, and user-friendly**, not complex or confusing. Here's a full **professional explanation** and a **corrected plan** for how your **Page Builder system** should work — especially when editing pages like services, sub-services, or feature pages.

---

## ✅ **Simplified and Effective Page Builder Strategy**

### 🎯 Objective:

To allow admins or editors to easily **edit any page** (e.g., main service, sub-service, feature) using either:

* **Text Editor (Simple Form View)**
* **Visual Builder (Drag-and-Drop Blocks)**

---

## 🔧 Features & Workflow for Page Editing

### 🖊️ **1. Edit Page Flow (Simple and Intuitive)**

#### ✅ Step-by-Step:

1. Go to `Pages` or `Services` section in dashboard.
2. Click on any page title (e.g., "Website Development").
3. Inside that page, show:

   * **Edit in Simple Mode (Text Fields)**
   * **Edit in Visual Mode (Page Builder)**

---

### ✏️ **2. Simple Text Editor Mode (Default for Quick Edits)**

This is for quick text and meta changes.

* Title
* URL Slug
* Meta Title / Description
* Content (WYSIWYG Editor)
* Header Image / Icon
* Status (Published/Draft)
* SEO Settings (Meta tags, Schema, Canonical)

✅ **Best for:** quick content edits, blog posts, FAQs, descriptions.

---

### 🧱 **3. Visual Page Builder Mode (Drag & Drop Layout)**

This should open an easy drag-and-drop layout builder. Think of it like WordPress Elementor or Wix.

#### Available Content Blocks:

* Hero Banner (image + heading + CTA)
* Text + Image section
* Features Grid
* Pricing Table
* FAQ Accordion
* Testimonials
* Video Block
* Call-to-Action
* Contact Form
* Custom HTML
* Section Divider / Backgrounds

✅ **Best for:** service landing pages, homepage, sales pages, and anything needing structure or layout design.

---

### 🧭 **4. Builder Interface Essentials**

* Drag and drop to rearrange blocks
* Click to edit inline text/images
* Add or delete sections
* Live preview toggle
* `Save as Draft`, `Publish`, or `Update`

---

### 🧰 **5. Integrated with Services Structure**

Make sure **Page Builder is available on all levels**:

| Page Type    | Builder Access | Content Editable | Visual Builder |
| ------------ | -------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Main Service | ✅              | ✅                | ✅              |
| Sub-Service  | ✅              | ✅                | ✅              |
| Feature Page | ✅              | ✅                | ✅              |

> ✅ Each service page should have a **“Edit”** button that lets user choose **Text Editor** or **Visual Builder** — not hidden in settings or complex menus.

---

### 🔐 **User Roles Access (Recommendation)**

| Role           | Can Use Builder | Can Use Text Editor | Can Publish |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| Admin          | ✅               | ✅                   | ✅           |
| Content Editor | ✅               | ✅                   | ✅           |
| SEO Manager    | ❌               | ✅                   | ❌           |
| Viewer         | ❌               | ❌                   | ❌           |

## 🚀 Final Prompt for Developer

> **Prompt:**
> "Build a simple and intuitive Page Editor where each page (Service, Sub-Service, Feature) offers two modes:

1. A default Text Editor for quick content updates, and
2. A Visual Page Builder for drag-and-drop layout design.
   The Page Builder should include standard content blocks (hero, text/image, grid, FAQ, etc.), support live previews, and allow easy publishing. This should be available at every page level, and accessible based on role permissions."
