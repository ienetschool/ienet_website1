SIMPLE SOLUTION - MANUAL FILE REPLACEMENT
========================================

The production server needs the new file. Here's the simple fix:

STEP 1: STOP PRODUCTION SERVER
------------------------------
SSH into your production server and run:
pkill -f node

STEP 2: BACKUP OLD FILE
-----------------------
mv mysql-production-server.cjs mysql-production-server.cjs.old

STEP 3: UPLOAD NEW FILE
-----------------------
Upload the file "EXACT_SAME_PRODUCTION_SERVER.cjs" from this Replit to your production server.
Rename it to: mysql-production-server.cjs

STEP 4: START NEW SERVER
------------------------
nohup node mysql-production-server.cjs > server.log 2>&1 &

VERIFICATION:
-------------
After restart, test:
curl "https://www.ienet.online/api/services/digital-marketing-seo/search-engine-optimization"

This should return the service data instead of "Endpoint not found".

WHY THIS WORKS:
---------------
The new file contains the exact same working routes from the development server,
just adapted for MySQL database with proper field mapping.
