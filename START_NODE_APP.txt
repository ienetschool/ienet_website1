FINAL STEP: START THE NODE.JS APPLICATION

Node.js is installed but the application needs to be started through Plesk.

ACTIONS NEEDED:

1. In the Node.js panel (screenshot you just shared), click "Restart App" button
   - This will start the working-production-server.cjs file

2. Check the application status
   - Should show "Running" status
   - Look for any error messages in the logs

3. If there are errors, check the server logs:
   - Click on the application name or logs section
   - Look for startup messages

4. Test the API after starting:
   curl https://www.ienet.online/api/health

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Status shows "Running" in Plesk Node.js panel  
- API calls return JSON data instead of 502 errors
- Service categories load on homepage
- Website fully functional

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If the app fails to start:
- Check if the working-production-server.cjs file is in the correct location
- Verify the Application Startup File path is correct
- Check Node.js logs for error messages
- Ensure the file has proper permissions

The Node.js application needs to be actively running for the API to work.
