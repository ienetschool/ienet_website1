RESTART PRODUCTION SERVER NOW
============================

The file was uploaded but the server is still running the old version in memory.

IMMEDIATE RESTART COMMANDS:
--------------------------

In your SSH terminal, run these commands:

1. Kill the current Node.js process:
   pkill -f node
   pkill -f mysql-production-server

2. Wait 2 seconds, then start the new server:
   nohup node mysql-production-server.cjs > server.log 2>&1 &

3. Check if it's running:
   ps aux | grep node

4. Test the new endpoint:
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/services/digital-marketing-seo/search-engine-optimization

VERIFICATION:
------------
After restart, this URL should work:
https://www.ienet.online/services/digital-marketing-seo/search-engine-optimization

The page titles and content will load correctly once the server restarts with the new code.
