IMMEDIATE PRODUCTION SERVER RESTART COMMANDS
==============================================

The issue is that the Node.js backend server on ienet.online has crashed.
This is causing 502 Bad Gateway errors for all API endpoints.

IMMEDIATE FIX COMMANDS:
----------------------

1. SSH into your production server:
   ssh username@your-server-ip

2. Navigate to website directory:
   cd /var/www/vhosts/ienet.online/httpdocs

3. Kill any existing Node.js processes:
   pkill -f node
   pkill -f "mysql-production-server"

4. Restart the production server:
   nohup node mysql-production-server.cjs > server.log 2>&1 &

5. Verify it's running:
   ps aux | grep node
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/service-categories

6. Check the logs if needed:
   tail -f server.log

VERIFICATION:
------------
After restart, these should work:
- https://www.ienet.online/api/service-categories
- https://www.ienet.online/services/digital-marketing-seo/search-engine-optimization
- All page titles and content should load properly

The development server works because it's running.
The production server doesn't work because the Node.js process stopped.
