ROUTE ORDER ISSUE DETECTED
=========================

The problem is ROUTE ORDER in Express.js!

ISSUE:
------
The specific route /api/services/:categorySlug/:serviceSlug 
must come AFTER the general route /api/services

CURRENT ORDER (WRONG):
1. /api/services/:categorySlug/:serviceSlug  (specific)
2. /api/services  (general)

CORRECT ORDER NEEDED:
1. /api/services  (general) 
2. /api/services/:categorySlug/:serviceSlug  (specific)

QUICK FIX:
----------
In your SSH terminal:

1. Edit the server file:
   nano mysql-production-server.cjs

2. Move the /api/services route to BEFORE the /api/services/:categorySlug/:serviceSlug route

3. Or simply delete lines 264-290 (the /api/services route) and restart

4. Restart server:
   pkill -f node
   nohup node mysql-production-server.cjs > server.log 2>&1 &

Express.js matches routes in order, so the specific route is catching all requests!
