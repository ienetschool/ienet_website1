NGINX SERVER FIX

Your server is running Nginx, not Apache. That's why "apache2.service not found" error appeared.

RUN THESE COMMANDS INSTEAD:

ssh root@5.181.218.15
cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/

# Check current files
ls -la

# Restart Nginx instead of Apache
systemctl reload nginx

# Or restart Nginx completely
systemctl restart nginx

# Check website status
curl -I https://www.ienet.online

# If still 403, try these permission fixes:
chown -R nginx:nginx ./*
# OR
chown -R www-data:www-data ./*

# Make sure index.html is readable
chmod 644 index.html
chmod -R 644 assets/*

NGINX CONFIGURATION:
Since you're using Nginx, the .htaccess file won't work. 
The React routing needs to be configured in Nginx directly through Plesk.

Your files are uploaded and permissions are set. 
The issue is likely Nginx configuration for serving React apps.
