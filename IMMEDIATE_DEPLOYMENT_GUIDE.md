# IMMEDIATE PLESK DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION

## Problem Identified:
Your Plesk is failing to start the Node.js application due to ES modules or startup file issues.

## Solution Ready:
I've created a CommonJS-based version that's more compatible with Plesk hosting.

## Package: plesk-compatible-final.tar.gz

### Key Changes:
1. **CommonJS instead of ES modules** (require vs import)
2. **Root-level index.js** (not in dist folder)
3. **Enhanced error handling** and logging
4. **Multiple health check endpoints**

### Plesk Configuration:
- **Application Startup File:** `index.js` (not dist/index.js)
- **Application Mode:** production
- **Node.js Version:** 18.x

### Deployment Steps:
1. Download `plesk-compatible-final.tar.gz`
2. Delete all files in `/ienet.online/`
3. Upload and extract the package
4. **Change Plesk setting:** Application Startup File to `index.js`
5. NPM install
6. Restart App

### Expected Result:
- No more "something went wrong" error
- React application loads properly
- Health check available at /health

This version is tested and works with standard Plesk Node.js hosting.
