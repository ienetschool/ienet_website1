MANUAL UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS

I cannot directly upload to your server. You need to upload these files manually.

FILES TO UPLOAD:

Download from this Repl and upload to your server:
- ienet-manual-upload.tar.gz (complete package)

OR upload individual files to /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/:

1. index.html
2. assets/index-4CY-Uz3T.css
3. assets/index-6-PKYvps.js  
4. production-server.cjs
5. package.json

AFTER UPLOADING, RUN ON SERVER:

ssh root@5.181.218.15
cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/

# If you uploaded the tar.gz:
tar -xzf ienet-manual-upload.tar.gz
mv manual-upload/* ./
rmdir manual-upload

# Install dependencies and start
npm install
chown -R vivaiind:psacln ./*
chmod -R 755 ./*
pkill -f "node" || true
nohup node production-server.cjs > production.log 2>&1 &

# Verify
ls -la
ls -la assets/
