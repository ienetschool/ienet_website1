EMERGENCY PLESK CONFIGURATION FIX

The 500 error suggests Apache directive conflicts. Let's use Plesk's default structure:

=== STEP 1: Remove ALL Custom Directives ===
In Plesk Apache & nginx Settings:
- Delete EVERYTHING from "Additional Apache directives for HTTP" (leave empty)
- Delete EVERYTHING from "Additional Apache directives for HTTPS" (leave empty)
- Delete EVERYTHING from "Additional nginx directives" (leave empty)
- Click OK and Apply

=== STEP 2: Use Default Plesk Structure ===
Go to Plesk File Manager and navigate to:
/var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/

Look for these default folders and use the first one you find:
1. httpdocs/
2. public_html/
3. www/
4. html/

=== STEP 3: Create index.html in Default Folder ===
Example: If you see httpdocs folder:
1. Go into httpdocs/
2. Create index.html file
3. Paste the complete HTML content

=== STEP 4: Alternative - Check Domain Settings ===
In Plesk:
1. Go to Domains > ienet.online
2. Check "Document Root" setting
3. Put index.html in whatever path is shown there

=== STEP 5: Last Resort - Main Directory ===
If no default folders exist:
1. Put index.html directly in: /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/index.html
2. Don't use any Apache directives at all

This approach uses Plesk's default configuration without any custom modifications that might cause conflicts.
