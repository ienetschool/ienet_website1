# Dashboard Access Paths

## Available Dashboards:

1. **Comprehensive Dashboard (MAIN DASHBOARD)**
   - Path: `/dashboard`
   - Features: Analytics, Page Builder, SEO Manager, Notifications
   - All action buttons working

2. **Admin Dashboard (Basic)**
   - Path: `/admin`
   - Features: Basic CRUD operations
   - Limited functionality

3. **Performance Dashboard**
   - Path: `/performance`
   - Features: Performance monitoring only

## How to Access:

1. Go to: `http://localhost:5000/dashboard`
2. Click on tabs: Analytics, Page Builder, SEO Manager, Notifications
3. All action buttons should work in the comprehensive dashboard

## Current Issues:
- User may be looking at `/admin` instead of `/dashboard`
- Action buttons only work in the comprehensive dashboard at `/dashboard`
