# DEPLOYMENT PACKAGE READY

## Production Deployment Completed

I've prepared your exact React development server for production deployment:

### Files Ready in final-deploy/:
1. **server-start.js** - Express server serving your React app
2. **package.json** - Production dependencies
3. **public/** - Built React application with all components
4. **deploy.sh** - Automated deployment script
5. **server-config.env** - Environment configuration

### Tested and Verified:
- Server starts correctly on port 3000
- Health endpoint responding
- React application serving properly
- All components included (HeroSlider, ModernHeader, FloatingCTA, About, Services, Testimonials)

### For Your Plesk Server:
Upload final-deploy/ contents to /ienet.online/ and:
- Set Application Startup File: server-start.js
- Click NPM install and Restart App

### Result:
ienet.online will serve your identical React development server application - same website, same components, same functionality.
