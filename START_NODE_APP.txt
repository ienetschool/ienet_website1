CHECK SERVER LOGS COMMAND

The fixed server was started but curl shows "Connection refused". 
Check what happened during startup:

ssh root@5.181.218.15
cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/

# Check if the fixed server log exists and what errors occurred
cat fixed-server.log

If the log file doesn't exist or shows errors:

1. Make sure mysql2 package is installed:
   npm install mysql2

2. Check if Node.js can run the file:
   node --version
   node fixed-production-server.cjs

3. If there are dependency errors, try:
   npm install express mysql2

4. Restart the server manually:
   nohup node fixed-production-server.cjs > fixed-server.log 2>&1 &

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
=== STARTING FIXED PRODUCTION SERVER ===
ðŸ”Œ Attempting MySQL connection...
âœ… MySQL connected successfully
âœ… Database test passed: X active service categories
ðŸš€ FIXED PRODUCTION SERVER STARTED!
âœ… Server listening on: http://127.0.0.1:3001

If you see database connection errors, the MySQL credentials or server might need verification.
