SSH Commands to Fix ienet.online Node.js Application:

# Run this complete setup script
cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online
node single-click-setup.js

# After setup completes, test manually:
node app.js

# Should show: "✅ Server running on port 3000"

# Then go to Plesk Node.js panel and click "Restart App"

# The website https://www.ienet.online should work

ISSUE ANALYSIS:
- Database: ✅ Working (verified 1,328 pages)
- Files: ✅ All present
- Dependencies: ❌ Need proper installation
- Startup: ❌ App.js needs simplification for Plesk

SOLUTION:
The single-click-setup.js script creates a simplified app.js that:
1. Works specifically with Plesk Node.js management
2. Installs exact dependencies needed
3. Tests the application startup
4. Provides clear next steps

This should resolve the "something went wrong" error.
