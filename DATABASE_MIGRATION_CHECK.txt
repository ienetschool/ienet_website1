DATABASE MIGRATION STATUS CHECK

API server is running and Nginx proxy is configured.
Now checking if database has the required data.

COMMANDS TO RUN ON SERVER:

ssh root@5.181.218.15

# Check if database tables exist
mysql -h 5.181.218.15 -u netiedb -p'h5pLF9833' ienetdb -e "SHOW TABLES;"

# Check if tables have data
mysql -h 5.181.218.15 -u netiedb -p'h5pLF9833' ienetdb -e "SELECT COUNT(*) as categories FROM service_categories;"
mysql -h 5.181.218.15 -u netiedb -p'h5pLF9833' ienetdb -e "SELECT COUNT(*) as projects FROM projects;"
mysql -h 5.181.218.15 -u netiedb -p'h5pLF9833' ienetdb -e "SELECT COUNT(*) as services FROM services;"

# If tables are empty, we need to import data from PostgreSQL
# First, export from development database:
# pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > development_data.sql

# Then convert and import to MySQL
# (This requires data migration from PostgreSQL to MySQL)

EXPECTED ISSUES:
1. Tables might not exist in MySQL
2. Tables might be empty (no data migrated)
3. Column names or types might be different between PostgreSQL and MySQL

SOLUTION: Need to migrate data from development PostgreSQL to production MySQL
