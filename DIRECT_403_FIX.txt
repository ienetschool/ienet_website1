DIRECT 403 FORBIDDEN FIX

The Nginx configuration is working now, but you're still getting 403 Forbidden.
This means the files aren't in the right location or don't have correct permissions.

RUN THESE COMMANDS IN SSH:

ssh root@5.181.218.15
cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/

# Check what files are actually there
ls -la

# Check if index.html exists and is readable
cat index.html | head -5

# Check the directory structure
pwd
ls -la ../

# Possible fixes:
# 1. Files might be in wrong location - check if they should be in httpdocs/
ls -la httpdocs/ 2>/dev/null

# 2. Set correct ownership for Nginx/Plesk
chown -R psaserv:psacln ./
chmod -R 755 ./
chmod 644 index.html
chmod -R 644 assets/*

# 3. Test direct file access
curl -I https://www.ienet.online/index.html

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
You should see your React app's index.html file content when running 'cat index.html'
If the file is empty or missing, that's the problem.
