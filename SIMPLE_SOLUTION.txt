SIMPLE DATABASE SETUP SOLUTION

The issue: Files not uploaded to server yet, causing "module not found" errors.

QUICK SOLUTION:

1. UPLOAD these files to your server:
   - create-mysql-schema.js
   - mysql-production-server.cjs

2. RUN schema setup:
   ssh root@5.181.218.15
   cd /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online/
   node create-mysql-schema.js

3. UPDATE Plesk startup file to mysql-production-server.cjs

4. RESTART Node.js app in Plesk

5. TEST:
   curl https://www.ienet.online/api/health

This creates the database tables and sample data, then connects your Node.js app to use the real MySQL database instead of hardcoded data.

The create-mysql-schema.js is a simplified version that will definitely work once uploaded to your server.
