STEPS:
1. Login to Plesk File Manager
2. Go to /ienet.online/ folder  
3. DELETE all existing files
4. Upload static-react-emergency.tar.gz
5. Extract the archive
6. DONE - NO Node.js configuration needed

WHAT THIS DOES:
- Serves React app directly through Apache

RESULT: 
ienet.online shows your React application with:
- HeroSlider with website development theme
