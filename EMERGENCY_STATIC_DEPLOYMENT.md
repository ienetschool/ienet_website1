# EMERGENCY: STATIC SITE DEPLOYMENT NEEDED

## Current Issue:
The React build files are deployed but the website is still showing cached old content. The server appears to be serving from a different cache or there's aggressive CDN caching.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION: Deploy Static HTML Version

Since the React SPA is having cache issues, let's deploy a static HTML version with the correct content:

### 1. Contact Page (Static HTML)
Create a static contact.html with:
- Title: "Contact IeNet" 
- Company: "Contact IeNet" in header
- Address: "101 SIYOL NAGAR, Laxman Nagar Road Via Chadi, Phalodi, JODHPUR 342312"

### 2. Privacy Policy (Static HTML)  
Create privacy.html with:
- Company: "India Espectacular"
- Indian compliance content
- Updated address

### 3. Terms of Service (Static HTML)
Create terms.html with:
- Company: "India Espectacular" 
- Indian governing law
- Updated address

### 4. NEW: Refund Policy (Static HTML)
Create refund.html with:
- Company: "India Espectacular"
- Complete refund policy
- Indian Consumer Protection Act compliance

## Why Static Solution:
1. Eliminates React/JS cache issues
2. Direct HTML serving - no build process
3. Immediate content updates visible
4. Works with any web server configuration
5. No dependency on Node.js API for content

## Deployment Steps:
1. Generate static HTML versions of all pages
2. Upload directly to httpdocs/
3. Clear all server caches
4. Test immediately

This approach guarantees the content will be served correctly without cache issues.
