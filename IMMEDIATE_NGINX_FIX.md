# IMMEDIATE FIX FOR PLESK NODE.JS ERROR

## Problem Identified
Your Plesk is looking for `dist/index.js` but the file doesn't exist.

## Solution Ready
I've created the missing `dist/index.js` file that Plesk needs.

## Upload Package: plesk-dist-deployment.tar.gz

### Files Included:
1. **index.js** - The startup file Plesk is looking for
2. **package.json** - Dependencies for Express
3. **public/** - Your React application files

### Deployment Steps:
1. Download `plesk-dist-deployment.tar.gz` from this Replit
2. In Plesk File Manager, go to `/ienet.online/`
3. Delete all existing files
4. Upload and extract `plesk-dist-deployment.tar.gz`
5. In Node.js settings, verify "Application Startup File: dist/index.js"
6. Click "NPM install"
7. Click "Restart App"

### Expected Result:
- Error "The file does not exist" will disappear
- Node.js app will start successfully  
- ienet.online will show your React application

This matches exactly what your Plesk configuration expects.
