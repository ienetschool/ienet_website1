PRODUCTION SERVER STILL NEEDS UPDATE
===================================

The production server is still using the old version without the new API endpoints.

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
-------------------------

1. The updated mysql-production-server.cjs file was not uploaded yet
2. The server needs to be restarted with the new file

UPLOAD STEPS:
------------

1. Upload the updated mysql-production-server.cjs file to your production server
   - Use Plesk File Manager or SCP
   - Replace the existing file

2. Upload the logo file: IE vector logo-01_1755535165852.png

3. Restart the server via SSH:
   cd [your-web-directory]
   pkill -f node
   nohup node mysql-production-server.cjs > server.log 2>&1 &

VERIFICATION:
------------
After upload and restart, this should return data instead of error:
curl https://www.ienet.online/api/services/digital-marketing-seo/search-engine-optimization

Until these files are uploaded, the production server will continue showing the same errors.
