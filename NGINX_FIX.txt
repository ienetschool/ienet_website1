NGINX DUPLICATE LOCATION FIX

The error shows there's already a location "/" block. Here are the solutions:

=== SOLUTION 1: Clear nginx directives and use only this ===

Clear the "Additional nginx directives" box completely and add ONLY this:

location / {
    root /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online;
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    index index.html;
}

=== SOLUTION 2: Use different location block ===

If Solution 1 doesn't work, try this instead:

location ~ ^/(.*)$ {
    root /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online;
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}

=== SOLUTION 3: Modify existing location ===

If there's already a location "/" block, replace the nginx box with:

try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
root /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online;
index index.html;

=== SOLUTION 4: Use Apache only ===

Remove ALL nginx directives and use only Apache directives:

Additional Apache directives for HTTP:
DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online
DirectoryIndex index.html

<Directory "/var/www/vhosts/vivaindia.com/ienet.online">
    Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule ^.*$ /index.html [L]
</Directory>

Try these solutions in order. Solution 4 (Apache only) is most likely to work.
