PRODUCTION DIRECTORY VERIFICATION
=================================

You're right to question the /httpdocs path. Let's verify the correct directory structure.

In your SSH terminal, please run these commands to find the correct path:

1. Check your current directory:
   pwd

2. List files to see what's there:
   ls -la

3. Check if you're already in the web root:
   ls -la index.html 2>/dev/null || echo "No index.html found"

4. Find where the React build files are located:
   find /var/www -name "index.html" 2>/dev/null | head -5

5. Check common web root locations:
   ls -la /var/www/html/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No /var/www/html"
   ls -la /var/www/vhosts/ienet.online/public_html/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No public_html"
   ls -la /var/www/vhosts/ienet.online/httpdocs/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No httpdocs"

UPLOAD TO THE CORRECT DIRECTORY:
===============================
Upload the files to wherever you see:
- index.html (React app)
- assets/ folder
- Other website files

This is your actual web root directory where the files should go.
