NGINX 502 ERROR DIAGNOSIS

The MySQL production server is running (PID 9363) but API calls return 502 errors.
This indicates a communication issue between Nginx and the Node.js server.

POSSIBLE CAUSES:
1. Node.js server running on wrong port
2. Nginx proxy configuration incorrect
3. Firewall blocking internal connections
4. Server not binding to correct interface

DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS:

1. Check if server is listening on port 3001:
   netstat -tulpn | grep 3001

2. Test local server directly:
   curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/health

3. Check server logs:
   tail -20 app.log

4. Check Nginx error logs:
   tail -20 /var/log/nginx/error.log

5. Verify Nginx configuration:
   nginx -t

LIKELY SOLUTION:
The mysql-production-server.cjs may need to be configured to bind to 127.0.0.1:3001
and Nginx needs to proxy /api/ requests to http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/

If diagnostics show the server is not responding on port 3001, the issue is in the Node.js server configuration.
